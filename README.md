# VStore
UE4 VR Supermarket project in collaboration with KCL

Current version is 4.26 

Logs are written to the C:/ drive   

The project uses small amount of C++ (mostly unessecary at this stage but will be requried later) so you may want to compile the project using an IDE before opening it up (typically it is good practice to generate the file beforehand); please contact the lead developer if assistance is required. 

Plugins have been included but can be shut off (most of them are not required but kept for future iterations)
